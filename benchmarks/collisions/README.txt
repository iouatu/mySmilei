beam_relaxation
----------------
e-i collisions
e beam of narrow energy spread
i background with Ti = 0.00002 mec2, mass=10
Beam gets strong isotropization and average velocity relaxes
But distribution gets strongly non-maxwellian => can only test theory around t=0
Cases 1,2,3 : initial velocity 0.05, ion charge 1
Cases 4,5,6 : initial velocity 0.01, ion charge 1
Cases 7,8,9 : initial velocity 0.01, ion charge 3
Each of these groups have 3 different ratios of particle weights: 0.1, 1, and 10.
Blue lines : longitudinal velocity
Blue dotted lines : quadratic perpendicular velocity = sqrt(<vperp2>)
Red lines : ion longitudinal velocity
Theory curves, (black lines) are taken from the NRL formulary.


Themalization ei
----------------
e-i collisions
electrons and ions have different temperatures which become equal.
Three cases for different ratios of weights : 0.2, 1 and 5
Blue lines : electron temperature
Red lines : ion temperature
Theory curves (black lines) from the NRL formulary

Temperature isotropization
--------------------------
e-e collisions
No ions
Temperature along x (longitudinal) is not equal to the others.
Blue line : longitudinal temperature
Red line : trnasverse temperature
Theory curves (black lines) from the NRL formulary

Maxwellianization
-----------------
e-e collisions
No ions
Ty = Tz = 0
Distribution along Px is initially a boxcar distribution
Blue lines : Vx distributions for different times
Red line : gaussian

Stopping power
--------------
e-e collisions
No ions
Background electrons of density 10 nc, and temperature 5 keV
Test electrons of various initial energy are slowed.
Black line is Frankel theory (PRA 1979).

Conductivity
------------
e-i collisions
Parameters of solid Cu at different temperatures (e-i equilibrium).
Note that each simulation contains several cases.
E-field of 0.001 is applied and forced constant.
Limit velocity is measured => conductivity deducted.
Black line is conductivity from code PARIS (from Lee & More, PoF (1984)).
Black dashed line is conductivity from related formula (Perez, PoP (2012)).
